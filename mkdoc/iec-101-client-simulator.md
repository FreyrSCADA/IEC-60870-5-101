â€‹Support all type of ASDU Typeid according to protocol specification

1) Monitoring (Process information in monitor direction), M_SP. M_DP, M_ST,...

2) control (Process information in control direction), C_SC, C_DC, ...

3)  System information in monitor direction, M_EI

4) System information in control direction C_IC, C_CI

5)  Parameter in control direction, P_ME

6) File transfer ( Both Monitor And Control Direction) F_FR, F_SR, F_SC


IEC 101 Client Simulator was originally developed to test the functionalities of IEC 60870-5-101 stack Client operation.

We can add up to 50 Client node in the simulator. Every Client node will work independently.

Simulator window shows the Connection status, connection port number.
