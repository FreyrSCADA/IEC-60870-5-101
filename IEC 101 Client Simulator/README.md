# [IEC 60870-5-101 Protocol](https://www.freyrscada.com/iec-60870-5-101.php)

RTU Server Simulator, Master Client Simulator, Windows and Linux POSIX ARM, IEC101 Source Code in C, C++, C# .NET Programming

Support both balanced and unbalanced mode.

IEC 60870-5 part 101 enables communication between IED, RTU control station and substation via a standard Serial network. 
IEC 60870 5 101 protocol (IEC 101) is a part of IEC Telecontrol Equipment and Systems Standard IEC 60870-5 that provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems in electrical engineering and power system automation.
IEC 60870 part 5 is one of the IEC 60870 set of standards which define systems used for telecontrol (supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA) in electrical engineering and power system automation applications. 
Part 5 provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The IEC Technical Committee 57 (Working Group 03) have developed a protocol standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for electric power systems. 
The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:

- IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
- IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
- IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
- IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
- IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions

## Licensing


### [Source Code License model:](https://www.freyrscada.com/iec-60870-5-101-Source-Code-Library.html)

In this License model, We deliver complete source code of the protocol implementation according to the customer specified operating system(Windows, Linux, QNX...).

Customer may embed the library into unlimited copies of Multiple end-use products for worldwide manufacturing, branding and distribution. Original equipment manufacturers choose this model. They usually have multiple products in their pipeline.


### Compiled Library License model:

In this License model, We deliver Dynamic/ Static compiled library (dll / lib) of the protocol implementation according to the customer specified operating system(Windows, Linux, QNX...).

Customer may embed the library into unlimited copies of Multiple end-use products for worldwide manufacturing, branding and distribution. Original equipment manufacturers choose this model. They usually have multiple products in their pipeline.


### Simulator License model:

Annual subscription Based license:

An Annual License allows the customer to use the licensed software for one year, download updates and request technical support. At the end of the year the customer must renew their term license to continue using the software.
In this License model, FreyrSCADA deliver Simulator Installer for Windows Operating System.
The Customer can use the software company wide. Customer can install the software in many systems. There is no restriction like Hardware key (Dongle) and software key. 

Unlimited year license:

A Perpetual License allows the customer to purchase a license to use the software forever. The Perpetual License also comes with an annual renewal fee that enables the customer to update the software to the latest version.
In this License model, FreyrSCADA deliver Simulator Installer for Windows Operating System.
The Customer can use the software company wide. Customer can install the software in many systems. There is no restriction like Hardware key (Dongle) and software key. 
For Unlimited year license, after a year, you will have the option to renew the Maintenance Plan to continue receiving technical support and upgrades.  The renewal price after a year is 10% of the product list price at the time of renewal (optional). Without renew the AMC also the software works. But for technical support and upgrades, the customer has an option for AMC.
